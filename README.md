# Pi-Dial
Pi-Dial consists of two Python programs that can be used with a Raspberry Pi to control a Denon audio-visual receiver (AVR).  You will also need 16x2 LCD display and two rotary encoders.

## Features
* Control the volume of Zone 2 using a rotary encoder
* Change the input source of Zone 2 using a rotary encoder
* Mute the receiver by pushing the volume rotary encoder
* Use the LCD display to show the current input, volume, and mute status
* `systemd` service files included to start the programs at boot
* 3D Printer STLs included (unfortunately, the CAD file has been lost)
